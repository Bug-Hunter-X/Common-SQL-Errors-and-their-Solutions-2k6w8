# Common SQL Errors and Their Solutions

This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when working with SQL databases and provides solutions to mitigate these issues.  These include:

* **Unhandled Exceptions:**  Failure to handle exceptions during database operations (constraint violations, etc.).
* **Transaction Management:** Incorrect usage of transactions leading to data inconsistencies.
* **Inefficient Queries:** Poorly written queries leading to performance bottlenecks.

The `bug.sql` file showcases these issues, while `bugSolution.sql` presents corrected and improved versions.
