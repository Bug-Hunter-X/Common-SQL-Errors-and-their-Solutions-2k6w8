In SQL, a common oversight is neglecting to handle potential exceptions or errors during database operations.  For instance, consider a situation where you are inserting data into a table that has constraints, such as a unique key constraint or a foreign key constraint. If you try to insert data that violates these constraints, the SQL operation will fail, and your application might not gracefully handle this failure. This can lead to unexpected behavior or even crashes.  

Another frequent issue is the improper use of transactions. Transactions are crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially when performing multiple database operations as a single unit of work. If you don't properly use transactions or handle transaction rollbacks, data inconsistencies could result.  Below is an example of how this can occur:

```sql
-- Incorrect transaction handling
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
--Operation 1
INSERT INTO table1 (id, value) VALUES (1, 'somevalue');
--Operation 2
INSERT INTO table2 (id, value) VALUES (1, 'anothervalue'); --Fails because of constraint
COMMIT TRANSACTION; -- Commits even with failure
```

Poorly written or inefficient SQL queries can also lead to performance bottlenecks. Using queries that are not optimized for the database's structure and indexes can cause slowdowns, especially as the database grows larger.  Another error is the misuse of aggregate functions (like COUNT, AVG, SUM) and grouping (GROUP BY) resulting in unexpected results.
